css notes: 
 /* change background-color to a personal preference  */
 /* change profile-picture and also make it black and white- more aestectically pleasing  */
 /* change logo simply uising the font family as a design */

 /* i think i need to create a flex box in the header div, to justify the gap between the 
logo and the navigation list; and also between the individual items within that list */

line 82 /* code below works for navigation bar AND LOGO! but not individual items.
instead, target class should be navigation-list__item?
also, add a specific class on logo to change its border-radius  */

line 90  /* transition-duration: 0.2s;
    transition-property: opacity; */
        /* i swapped the transition effects over to increase interactivity- didn't work
     for the cv button  (.button class) */
